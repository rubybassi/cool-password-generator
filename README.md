# Javascript: Password Generator

## Background

This project is my attempt of creating a random password generator application. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. I also ensured the HTML elements followed a semantic structure and that the site was responsive through the use of CSS media queries. Comments were added throughout the Javascript file, highlighting the key coding blocks and evidence of console.log testing.
